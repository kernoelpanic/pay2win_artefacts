# Calculations, plots, simulations, ...

All calculations, plots, simulations have been made in python3.7.
Jupyter notebooks have been used for presentation purposes and to provide some context. 
 
You should be able to reproduce them by creating a `virtualenv` with all 
requirements listed in `requirements.txt` installed. 

The `Makefile` can help you with that:
```bash
$ make init
...
$ make start # starts jupyter 
```
If you just want to look at the results, you can find HTML exports of the jupyter notebook in every directory.
