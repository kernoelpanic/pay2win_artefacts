# Calculations, plots, simulations, ...

All calculations, plots, simulations have been made in python.
Jupyter notebooks have been used for presentation purposes and to provide some context. 
 
You should be able to reproduce them by creating a `virtualenv` with all 
requirements listed in `requirements.txt` installed. 

The `Makefile` can help you with that:
```bash
$ make init
...
$ make start # starts jupyter 
```
